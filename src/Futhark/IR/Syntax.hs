-- | = Definition of the Futhark core language IR
--
-- For actually /constructing/ ASTs, see "Futhark.Construct".
--
-- == Types and values
--
-- The core language type system is much more restricted than the core
-- language.  This is a theme that repeats often.  The only types that
-- are supported in the core language are various primitive types
-- t'PrimType' which can be combined in arrays (ignore v'Mem' for
-- now).  Types are represented as t'TypeBase', which is parameterised
-- by the shape of the array and whether we keep uniqueness
-- information.  The t'Type' alias, which is the most commonly used,
-- uses t'Shape' and t'NoUniqueness'.
--
-- This means that the records, tuples, and sum types of the source
-- language are represented merely as collections of primitives and
-- arrays.  This is implemented in "Futhark.Internalise", but the
-- specifics are not important for writing passes on the core
-- language.  What /is/ important is that many constructs that
-- conceptually return tuples instead return /multiple values/.  This
-- is not merely syntactic sugar for a tuple: each of those values are
-- eventually bound to distinct variables.  The prettyprinter for the
-- IR will typically print such collections of values or types in
-- curly braces.
--
-- The system of primitive types is interesting in itself.  See
-- "Futhark.IR.Primitive".
--
-- == Overall AST design
--
-- Internally, the Futhark compiler core intermediate representation
-- resembles a traditional compiler for an imperative language more
-- than it resembles, say, a Haskell or ML compiler.  All functions
-- are monomorphic (except for sizes), first-order, and defined at the
-- top level.  Notably, the IR does /not/ use continuation-passing
-- style (CPS) at any time.  Instead it uses Administrative Normal
-- Form (ANF), where all subexpressions t'SubExp' are either
-- constants 'PrimValue' or variables 'VName'.  Variables are
-- represented as a human-readable t'Name' (which doesn't matter to
-- the compiler) as well as a numeric /tag/, which is what the
-- compiler actually looks at.  All variable names when prettyprinted
-- are of the form @foo_123@.  Function names are just t'Name's,
-- though.
--
-- The body of a function ('FunDef') is a t'Body', which consists of
-- a sequence of statements ('Stms') and a t'Result'.  Execution of a
-- t'Body' consists of executing all of the statements, then returning
-- the values of the variables indicated by the result.
--
-- A statement ('Stm') consists of a t'Pattern' alongside an
-- expression 'ExpT'.  A pattern contains a "context" part and a
-- "value" part.  The context is used for things like the size of
-- arrays in the value part whose size is existential.
--
-- For example, the source language expression @let z = x + y - 1 in
-- z@ would in the core language be represented (in prettyprinted
-- form) as something like:
--
-- @
-- let {a_12} = x_10 + y_11
-- let {b_13} = a_12 - 1
-- in {b_13}
-- @
--
-- == Lores
--
-- Most AST types ('Stm', 'ExpT', t'Prog', etc) are parameterised by a
-- type parameter with the somewhat silly name @lore@.  The lore
-- specifies how to fill out various polymorphic parts of the AST.
-- For example, 'ExpT' has a constructor v'Op' whose payload depends
-- on @lore@, via the use of a type family called t'Op' (a kind of
-- type-level function) which is applied to the @lore@.  The SOACS
-- representation ("Futhark.IR.SOACS") thus uses a lore
-- called @SOACS@, and defines that @Op SOACS@ is a SOAC, while the
-- Kernels representation ("Futhark.IR.Kernels") defines
-- @Op Kernels@ as some kind of kernel construct.  Similarly, various
-- other decorations (e.g. what information we store in a t'PatElemT')
-- are also type families.
--
-- The full list of possible decorations is defined as part of the
-- type class 'Decorations' (although other type families are also
-- used elsewhere in the compiler on an ad hoc basis).
--
-- Essentially, the @lore@ type parameter functions as a kind of
-- proxy, saving us from having to parameterise the AST type with all
-- the different forms of decorations that we desire (it would easily
-- become a type with a dozen type parameters).
--
-- Defining a new representation (or /lore/) thus requires you to
-- define an empty datatype and implement a handful of type class
-- instances for it.  See the source of "Futhark.IR.Seq"
-- for what is likely the simplest example.
